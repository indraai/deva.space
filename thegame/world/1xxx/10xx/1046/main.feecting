## Hide In The Leaves

p:You hide in the cluster-leaf tree. The strange creatures pass by except for one straggler, who stops to stretch. For a moment he looks right at you. "Kota zaark!" he cries, then turns and runs after the others.

p:Perhaps you needn't have been so cautious.

p:The creature looked more like a frightened animal than a fierce hunter.

p:As you climb down from the tree, you hear a low moaning coming from the brush. A pair of bright blue lights is shining from within the darkness.
