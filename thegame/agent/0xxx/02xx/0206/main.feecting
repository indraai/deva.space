## Henry B. Messenger

He is a large middle-aged man missing most of his hair. He ambles about seemingly oblivious to his own girth and the world around him. Occasionally he rambles on about truth, existence, and other esoteric topics that better mind than his have already questioned.

Hi, my real name is Henry B. Messenger, and I live in Campbell, California. I share a house with a couple of way cool guys (who also crew for me), and we share a T1 into our place (see Explosive Networking).

When I'm not at work, I spend as much time as possible sailing, listening to unusual music, playing around on the angst MUSH, playing keyboards and guitar with my friends out in the server room and playing computer games.

I'm also famous for my mochas, cooking and foot massages (I am not kidding).

My drink of choice around the house is Jim Beam with a Dr. Pepper back (don't knock it until you've tried it), and Dark'n'Stormys on the boat.
