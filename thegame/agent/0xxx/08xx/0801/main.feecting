describe:I wanted to get my website in your ezine again, and tell everyone how ethical hacking is the best hacking ever. I have included bronc's bash history from one of my machines. Also, remember young hackers, if you break into a system, tell the admin how to patch it, do a good deed for society. If you hack any child porn people, turn them into authorities and send all of the downloaded movie/picture evidence to my personal account: rloxley@hackphreak.org. Stop child porn!
